This repository holds the parameters and instructions for 'Fig5: Anonymity with fixed vs variable propagation delays $\tau$'.




Instructions for Fig5:
    In order to parallelize the computation set 'p = Pool(processes=4, maxtasksperchild=1)' and 'param = [1, 5, 10, 15]" 'nohup python3 main.py &' in main.py
    set 'n_layer = rate'
    When the simulation time is reached, result will be '/Logs/Entropy.csv'
